### Contributor Code of Conduct

We follow the [CNCF Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Additionally, we commit to the following guidelines as detailed on the [Linkerd Code of Conduct](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/wiki/Linkerd-code-of-conduct):

### Community Guidelines

#### Principles

- Our goal is to foster an inclusive and diverse community of technology enthusiasts.

- Try to be your best self. Treat your fellow community members with kindness and empathy. We welcome disagreements when they are conducted respectfully and without personal attacks.

- We ask that you keep unstructured critique to a minimum. Disparaging remarks about the project are unnecessary and a drain on community morale. Feedback should be constructive and relevant. Having passionately held opinions on what should improve is encouraged! We hope you will use that enthusiasm to roll up your sleeves and get involved by submitting pull requests. We have additional guidelines on [how to ask constructive questions](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd/wiki/How-To-Ask-Questions-in-Slack).

- We don't tolerate insults, spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or harassment. We don't tolerate sexual language, imagery, or unwanted advances. Private harassment is also unacceptable.

- We do our best to avoid [subtle-isms](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules): small actions that make others feel uncomfortable. If you witness a subtle-ism, you may respectfully point it out to the person publicly or privately, or you may ask a moderator to say something. Accidentally saying something biased is common, expected, and readily forgiven. It is not in and of itself a bannable offense.

#### Workplace Color Spectrum

Taking examples from several organizations (see References), we identify this spectrum of interactions:

Green:
In this interaction everyone was socially aware and respectful. Everyone considered and listened to others' perspectives, even if they disagreed with opinions or proposals.

Yellow:
In this interaction someone was overly reactive. A "knee jerk" reaction to a statement, outcome, or situation caused frustration, anger, or some other negativity to surface *and* result in impacting others' comfortability, feeling of belonging in the community, or otherwise caused disruption. It is completely human to have negative emotions, but we must respectfully manage our emotions and not unleash them upon others.
Much like subtle-isms, nearly everyone will on occassion dip into Yellow. To err is human. It shows emotional maturity to recognize when this has happened and apologize for the behavior. It is a community concern if the situation keeps repeating, resulting in a warning and eventual banning.

Red:
Either excessive repeating of Yellow, or outright harassment, insults, etc. as listed non-exhaustively in Principles.
These interactions contribute to a toxic environment, are disruptive to productivity, and cause an unwelcoming or unsafe atmosphere.
Red interactions are likely to result in at least temporary bans.

Threats and violence will result in immediate permanent bans and involvement of law enforcement.

### Moderation

Please report any Code of Conduct violations to [this confidential google form](https://forms.gle/HipfZoXdciReACDM9) or to the [SPIFFE Steering Committee (SSC) email](mailto:ssc@spiffe.io).

If you feel any of SPIFFE's communication channels require moderation, please e-mail the [SSC](mailto:ssc@spiffe.io).

The SSC will investigate all reports in a reasonable timeframe.
The SSC encourages timely reporting so that any potential evidence or other investigations will be more viable.
At the end of an investigation, the SSC will respond to reporters with the high-level conclusion of any action resulting from their report. If you would like clarity on a decision, the SSC is happy to discuss. If you are unsatisfied and still believe the situation requires escalation, report to [the CNCF Code of Conduct Committee](https://www.cncf.io/conduct/committee/).

Retaliation against Code of Conduct reporters will result in a permanent ban.

The SSC confidentially tracks all reports centrally, discussing information only with other CoC bodies under CNCF/Linux Foundation and only on an as-needed basis. All past SSC members are expected to continue to respect this confidentiality indefinitely- the SSC will consider it an egregious Code of Conduct violation to expose such information.

When discussing violations with a user, the SSC will make reasonable attempts to generalize information so that it is still useful but not identifying of the reporter. This will not always be possible (eg., if a report is made regarding a 1-on-1 interaction).

The SSC will issue a warning to users who don't follow this code of conduct. A second offense results in a temporary ban. A third offense warrants a permanent ban. It is at the SSC's discretion to un-ban offending users, or to immediately ban a user without warning due to egregious action (violence, threats).
