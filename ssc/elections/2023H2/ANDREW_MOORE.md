# Andrew Moore
I am grateful for the confidence given to have me on the SSC today, and hope I can continue to serve on the committee.

Since February 2019 I have been leading SPIRE adoption and integrations at Uber across a hetereogeneous set of architectures, platforms, and cloud providers through every slice of our tech stack and devops. My experience with SPIRE is at large scale for both admin operations and workload interactions. While since last election I've been bumped down from the Number 3 contributor on SPIRE to Number 6, I actively push and drive for my own organization's resources to make their own contributions into the product, be it small observability changes or large feature sets such as LRU Cache.

I have owned and driven multiple SPIFFE migrations across my organization, and will be continuing to do so for a long time to come.

In the SPIFFE community, I can be seen giving user help, engaging with the `helm-charts` project, and working with the rest of SSC to discover and define what the optimal shape and processes of the committee itself are to best serve the community.
