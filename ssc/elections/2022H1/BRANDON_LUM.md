# Brandon Lum
Brandon Lum has many years under his belt in the authentication, authorization, and trusted computing spaces. As the CNCF Security TAG co-chair, he is also intimately familiar with the cloud native community, open source software, and broader infosec industry trends. Brandon is one of the founding maintainers of project Tornjak (a control plane and web UI for managing multiple SPIRE deployments), and given his experience in both the technical and social aspects of projects like SPIFFE/SPIRE, I feel he would be a great (and very effective) member of the SSC.
