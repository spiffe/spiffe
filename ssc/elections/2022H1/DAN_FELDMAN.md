# Daniel Feldman
Daniel has been involved in SPIFFE almost since it's inception (2018), and has become a tireless advocate for the community since then. He is active daily in a number of Slack channels around the project, as well as a frequent contributor and speaker. He has played an active role in driving a number of SPIFFE migrations for organisations and teams of significant size. Behind the scenes, he's been an advocate for improving the usability and accessibility of SPIRE, something the project can certainly benefit from. I can think of few more qualified people to be a community steward and SSC member.
