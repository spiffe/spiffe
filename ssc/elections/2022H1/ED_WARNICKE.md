# Ed Warnicke
I am honored to nominate Ed Warnicke for the SPIFFE Steering Committee. Ed is a long time user of SPIFFE/SPIRE, integrating it as a core component in Network Service Mesh. Through this experience, Ed has provided thoughtful feedback with a focus on useability and utility. For example, Ed is currently championing the design of SPIFFE ID Templating for Kubernetes workloads as seen in https://github.com/spiffe/spire/issues/2280 which will cover an important Kubernetes usability gap. The SPIFFE community would greatly benefit from Edâ€™s extensive open source governance and deep tech experience. 

Here is a brief bio:

> Ed Warnicke is a Distinguished Engineer at Cisco Systems. He has been working for over two decades in many areas of networking and Open Source. Ed is currently a FD.io TSC Member, and a founder of and active contributor to the Network Service Mesh and GitBOM projects. Ed has a masters in Physics (String Theory) from Rutgers University.
> 
> Among other noteworthy activities, Warnicke was the FD.io TSC chair for six year, on the TAC at LFN for four years and is currently on the TAC at LFPH. He is a founding TSC member at OpenDaylight, is consistently in the top 70 individuals (#62 currently) on devstat for most PRs opened on CNCF projects, and is formerly a Wireshark maintainer.

## Words from Ed
Ed answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
Good Steering Committees bring multiple perspectives that enhance their communities. The perspectives I bring are:
1. A long time user of Spiffe in an Open Source project ([Network Service Mesh](https://networkservicemesh.io/) project at CNCF).  Who has pushed the edges in using Spiffe (Federation, Transitive Identity, etc)
2. A very experienced member of Open Source Steering Committees (founding TSC Member at OpenDaylight, long time TSC Chair at FD.io, LFPH TAC member, CNCF TAG-Network co-chair.  I've seen enough to see some of the things that work and don't, and also so much as to know there is no single right answer and communities needs and personalities vary.
3. Who still writes a lot of code (currently #62 out of ~20k CNCF contributors on [devstats](https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/22/prs-authors-table?orgId=1))
4. Is very interested in ensuring Spiffe/Spire has excellent usability (see [Add Spiffe ID templating for k8s-workload-registrar](https://github.com/spiffe/spire/issues/2280) for one example).

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I'm very interested in bringing my long deep background in Steering committees to bear.   I'm also very interested in continuing to engage on issues of  usability.  That which is hard to use, doesn't get used, or is circumvented.  Security _requires_ usability.
