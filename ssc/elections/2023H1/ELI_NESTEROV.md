# Eli Nesterov
Eli is a long-time SPIFFE community member and previously designed and operated the world's largest SPIRE deployment, exceeding 1,000,000 nodes. Over the years, he has had an outsized influence on the projects, and has seen them used in places and ways that few other people have. As such, he has a very strong understanding of the workload identity landscape overall, as well as how and where SPIFFE shines (and where it does not). Eli cares deeply about SPIFFE and the community that we have built here, and it is difficult for me to imagine a nominee more qualified than himself.
