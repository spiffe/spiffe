# Volkan Ozcelik
Volkan is the author of [Aegis](https://aegis.ist/index.html), the founder of [Zero to Hero](https://www.zerotohero.dev/), and last but not least, is truly a force of his own. With an uncanny ability to explain complicated topics in a very succinct way, he is not just an accomplished technologist, but also a prolific creator. Through his tutorials, videos, livestreams and the like, Volkan has very significantly broadened the SPIFFE community. Along the way, he's gained a strong understanding of the SPIFFE and cloud native ecosystem at large, and captured hearts and minds globally. If elected, I believe that Volkan will bring a broad and far reaching perspective to the SSC, a wholistic representation of the industry at large. Further, he is well equipped to connect on a personal basis with our community and others - a skill which is truly invaluable in this setting.
