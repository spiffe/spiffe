# Frederick Kautz

## Bio:

My goal is to bring SPIFFE to the Agentic community. I have been delivering keynotes and building support for the community through significant outreach at events in the San Francisco and Silicon Valley region. I am actively introducing SPIFFE to the Agentic AI communities and startups in the SF Bay Area, educating and winning support from these organizations to incorporate SPIFFE into their stacks to secure agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication. My mission is to build ground support for organizations to start building their AI agent networks on top of SPIFFE and supporting technologies for policy enforcement.

My bio:

Frederick Kautz is a distinguished leader in open-source and cloud-native communities, with over 10 years of kubernetes and docker experience, extensive expertise in software supply chain security, Zero Trust, and networking.

Frederick co-authored the influential NIST Special Publication 800-204D, Strategies for the Integration of Software Supply Chain Security in DevSecOps CI/CD Pipelines, which has significantly influenced the Department of Defense's Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals version 2.5 by defining the software supply chain.

Frederick created in-toto Archivista, an open source graph and storage service for in-toto attestations. This tool enables the discovery and retrieval of attestations for software artifacts, enhancing the security and integrity of software supply chains. By providing a trusted store for supply chain metadata, in-toto Archivista allows organizations to store and query attestations, facilitating policy validation and flexible querying through an efficient and horizontally scalable GraphQL API.

At Elevance Health, Frederick served as the lead architect for the Sydney Health app, a comprehensive mobile platform that provides users with personalized health information, digital ID cards, and access to care services. Collaborating closely with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the security team, Frederick was instrumental in defining the company's Zero Trust strategy and the onboarding of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), transforming Elevance Health's cloud infrastructure for secure, scalable growth.

His leadership extends to his tenure as Co-Chair of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (now Emeritus), where he helped expand the global cloud-native community and set new standards for security and inclusivity. As a current member of the SPIFFE Steering Committee, Frederick continues to drive standards in workload identity and Zero Trust.

As an innovator, Frederick co-founded OmniBOR and ProtoBOM, advancing transparency in binary provenance and software bill of materials (SBOM) practices. In 2019, he developed one of the first federated learning platforms for healthcare, enabling collaborative research while preserving patient privacy. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Network Service Mesh. He has contributed to modernizing network infrastructure for secure, cloud-native networking solutions. He also defined the "CNF: Cloud Native Network Function," which transformed network service provider architectures by enabling them to run on cloud architectures like Kubernetes.

Frederick currently works at TestifySec Inc. where he focuses on Software Supply Chain Security.
