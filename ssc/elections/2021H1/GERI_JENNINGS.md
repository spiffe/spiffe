# Geri Jennings
**Nomination submitted by @evan2645:** Geri is a well-respected member of the cloud native security community, and often volunteers her time to push community efforts forward. She is also well-versed in the AuthN and identity space, and is one of the authors of the Secretless project. Geri has seen the problems first hand, and spends a significant amount of time thinking about them. If she accepts this nomination and is elected, I think Geri's experience and perspective will become a central and indispensable part of the SSC.

## Words From Geri
Geri answered the following questions in support of her nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I first became aware of SPIFFE / SPIRE when I joined the CNCF Security SIG in April 2018. At the time, I was working as a software engineer building a transparent authentication proxy that CyberArk eventually released as [Secretless Broker](https:/github.com/cyberark/secretless-broker). I joined the CNCF Security SIG so that I could be a part of the conversations happening around cloud-native security, and I found in SPIFFE a project that used familiar terminology (like _zero trust_ and _least privilege_) to describe the ideal, safe, developer-friendly path forward.

In my work over the past several years as a cloud-native vendor, the central role that SPIFFE / SPIRE play in the cloud-native security landscape has become clear. In the end, privileged access management in dynamic, modern environments isn't possible without a mechanism to _identify_ the workloads running in these environments - or put another way, modern access control requires a modern mechanism for defining what a workload's _identity_ is.

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I've always appreciated and respected the work of the SPIFFE team and have looked for opportunities to personally contribute. With the creation of the SSC, I am happy to have found something that will use my skills! The work ahead of the group is very much in line with my recent experience as an engineering manager responsible for building the open-source program at CyberArk. I am really excited to be able to engage with the SPIFFE community and to collaborate with the SSC members on defining the mission and values, tracking the progress and goals, and building the governance model!

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
I'm really grateful to be nominated, and with group of co-nominees who I respect a lot. This will be a great inaugural SPIFFE Steering Committee!
