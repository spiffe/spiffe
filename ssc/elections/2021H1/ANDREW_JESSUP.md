# Andrew Jessup
**Nomination submitted by @evan2645:** Andrew has been a champion for SPIFFE since its practical inception. Drawing on his previous experience as an engineer and product manager at Google and elsewhere, Andrew has been instrumental in helping to breathe life into SPIFFE in its early days. He understands the landscape well, and is a strong user advocate with focus on usability and totality. Should he accept this nomination, I think he'd bring a wealth of value and perspective to the SSC.

## Words From Andrew
Andrew answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I was one of the co-founders of Scytale and led the first draft of the SPIRE design doc (based on Joe Beda's white paper) in 2017. Since then I've spent most of my professional energy helping to catalyse the SPIFFE community, understanding what members of that community are trying to achieve with the SPIFFE project (including over 100 interviews with community members) as well as building an understanding of the markets and industry segments adjacent to SPIFFE (such as secrets management, service mesh, certificate management and IAM).

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
As SPIFFE grows and evolves I'm hoping to use the insight I've gained from the last 4 years of working with the community to help identify unmet needs (such as transitive identity and delegated claims), help the SSC and maintainers evaluate the potential benefits and risks of different design decisions, and help to be a conduit between the SSC and maintainers and the community at large.
