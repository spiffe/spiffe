# Andrew Moore
**Nomination submitted by @rturner3:** Since February 2019, in his role as software engineer at Uber, Andrew has directly contributed to the adoption of SPIFFE and SPIRE at Uber. He has worked on integrating SPIRE with a diverse set of production workloads at Uber ranging from low-level infrastructure platforms to higher level services, workflows, and build/test jobs. He has also made significant contributions to Uber authentication libraries leveraging SPIFFE identity delivered by SPIRE that are widely adopted across the organization. Andrew has 1.5 years experience of operating a large-scale deployment of SPIRE at Uber. He is one of the top contributors to the SPIRE project by number of commits and lines of code contributed.

Andrew is an advocate for SPIFFE at Uber, establishing consensus with service and platform owners at Uber and establishing internal best practices and conventions. He has planned and executed SPIFFE ID path convention migrations and understands many of the challenges with the workload identity problem space. For these reasons, I believe Andrew Moore would be a good fit for the SSC.

## Words From Andrew
Andrew answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I have been working on the Uber integration with SPIRE since 2019, focusing on production readiness and observability for our 200k+ SPIRE agents.  
I have shifted from directly writing PRs to internally organizing contribution efforts as our team grew based on our real production experience. Somehow, my many PRs from earlier days still have me as the #3 contributor to SPIRE in the `Insights` tab :)  
I am the owner of our internal consumer onboarding experience, and so have learned much both on operating SPIRE and on supporting user adoption of it within an organization.  

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I am most excited for any enhancements I can bring to user adoption. I look forward to engaging with users in the community to better understand the kinds of use cases across the industry and translating those requirements, leveraging my own experience operating SPIRE, into contributions that empower users to build secure systems.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
I would just like to thank Ryan Turner for the nomination.
