## Words From Eric
Eric has answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I am a good fit for the steering committee because I bring the perspective of a SPIFFE project user and operator at an organization with a diverse set of infrastructures and workloads: Cloud, On-premise, containerized, and not.  I have been a member of the community from the first Scytale in-person community days and have presented my team's work at community events. I am familiar with the problem space and the organizational and non-technical perspective of framing the value proposition to users across Security, Operations, and Product as well as the regulatory concerns of building high assurance software for regulated environments.

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I am most excited about making SPIFFE more approachable and turn-key for the uninitiated user.  The problem space of issuing cryptographic identity to workloads is challenging and a high-risk change for organizations. While introducing SPIFFE to my organization I have always found the existing community welcoming, responsive and thoughtful in its assistance to me and my teams. There is context as an operator of the system I would like to see incorporated into the project's priorities from an operability and debugability standpoint, by bringing these challenges to light or popularizing existing community solutions. I think we've only seen the beginning of SPIFFE's utility to the software world.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
Should I not be elected I would welcome the opportunity to continue contributing to the community and elected SSC members by sharing whatever context I can.
