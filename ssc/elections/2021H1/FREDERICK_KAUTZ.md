## Words From Frederick
Frederick answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I am a good fit for the SPIFFE steering committee because of my experience working with SPIFFE from multiple roles:
* As an open source project maintainer, I facilitated bringing in SPIFFE and its reference implementation SPIRE as a key component of Network Service Mesh.
* As an end-user software architect, I have spent a significant portion of the past year and a half bringing SPIFFE into high-impact projects, including a fortune 50. These efforts have resulted in contributions back to the community, including the AWS KMS plugin for holding and using SPIRE's CA material.
* As an edge infrastructure and security open source contributor, I have contributed to high-impact communities, helping others learn about what SPIFFE/SPIRE are and how they can use it to establish cloud-native zero trust in multiple domains. I actively participate in IEEE Future Network, CNCF Telecom User Group, CNCF CNF Working Group, IEEE Decentralized Clinical Trials.
* As an evangelist, I have spoken at multiple significant conferences, including KubeCon, Open Networking Summit, HPE Discover, Cisco ScaleX, and SPIFFE Production Identity Days.
* I co-authored the SPIFFE Book! üê¢

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I am most excited about meeting new people and learning about what works and where the gaps are. The strength of SPIFFE will be in its community. Sound security patterns are more than just technology; they are about humans and their processes.  
A successful cloud adoption strategy will center around how it empowers humans to build, integrate, and defend heterogeneous systems with ease. SPIFFE is a crucial technology to that goal.  
Regardless of the result, my goal will be to establish a flexible framework to help people adopt a Cloud-Native Zero-Trust Strategy for their infrastructure and a strategy for scaling from small deployments to large cross-organizational fleets.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
Thank you for your consideration.
