# Brian Martin
**Nomination submitted by @esweiss:** Brian works full time on the SPIRE project for HPE as a Master Software Engineer and architect.  He brings a wealth of experience to his role, having previous experience with technical leadership roles at Plexxi, VMWare, Virsto and EMC.  Brian has a deep undertanding of SPIFFE's problem space, excellent communications skills and the right temperment for a seat on the SSC. 

## Words From Brian
Brian has answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I met SPIFFE (and SPIRE) two years ago while architecting and prototyping a demonstration of "cloudless" computing on zero trust networks. I saw the potential and benefits of leveraging SPIFFE to secure communications within and across clusters inside and outside organizations. Managing the rotation of keys and certificates greatly simplified solutions as well, reducing friction for increased security adoption. Having worked with Kubernetes since 2016, I feel the applicability of SPIFFE across networks, service meshes, and applications.

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I am excited about bringing my passion for simplifying IT, and security in particular, to the SPIFFE Steering Committee. I have invested three decades in scalable distributed systems and simplifying complexities. As SPIFFE crosses the tipping point into broader adoption, I hope to help steward it through increasing visibility and reducing friction. SPIFFE lives at the intersection of many great projects, products, and solutions. Driving adoption and coordination with other open source projects will make improved security available to a greater slice of our ecosystem.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
I am engaged with SPIFFE SIG-SPEC, driving changes to ease adoption and application of SVIDs for workloads. I have also undertaken a deep dive into refactoring the SPIRE datastore, cleaning up interfaces, adding Key Value store support, and increasing scalability to millions of nodes and entries. At the other end of the scale, I use SPIFFE and SPIRE on an ARM cluster in a mobile datacenter.
