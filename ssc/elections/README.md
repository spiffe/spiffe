# SSC Elections
Welcome to the SSC elections. Here you will find information about how SSC elections are conducted, as well as past and current SSC elections.

For information about a specific election, please see the relevant subdirectory.

## SSC Election Process
Current membership and term dates can be seen [here](../README.md). Multiple seats may be open in a single election.

Each SSC election has a dedicated subdirectory and tracking issue in this repository. The tracking issue can be subscribed to by interested parties, and will be updated as the election progresses.

All nominees are proposed via GitHub Pull Request, and each nominee gets a dedicated file in the relevant subdirectory (e.g. `2021H1` for the first election of 2021). A list of eligible participants, as well as detailed instructions on how to participate in the election process, are documented in the subdirectory's README.

The rest of this section captures the exact steps necessary to begin and complete an SSC election. These steps are to be performed by an SSC member, or appointed party.

Eligible participants are initially found via a GitHub search, since all other discovery processes would be manual. This is not intended as an exclusion of community members who are not active in GitHub but otherwise do participate in SPIFFE workstreams.
However, for candidates a GitHub account is required as this is how SSC members gain administrative rights on the SPIFFE projects.
