# Brian Martin
I've been working with SPIFFE (and SPIRE) for two and a half years, beginning with a demonstration of "cloudless" computing on zero trust networks. I am engaged with SPIFFE SIG-SPEC, driving changes to ease adoption and application of SVIDs for workloads. I also contributed to work on refactoring the SPIRE datastore, and work on adding Key Value store support. I use SPIFFE and SPIRE on an ARM cluster in a mobile datacenter.

I believe I my passion for simplifying IT, and security in particular, to the SPIFFE Steering Committee. Having worked with Kubernetes since 2016, I feel the applicability of SPIFFE across networks, service meshes, and applications. I have previous experience with technical leadership roles at Plexxi, VMWare, Virsto and EMC.
