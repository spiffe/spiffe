I am honored to nominate Ed Warnicke for the SPIFFE Steering Committee. Ed is a long time user of SPIFFE/SPIRE, integrating it as a core component in Network Service Mesh. Through this experience, Ed has provided thoughtful feedback with a focus on useability and utility. For example, Ed is currently championing the design of SPIFFE ID Templating for Kubernetes workloads as seen in https://github.com/spiffe/spire/issues/2280 which will cover an important Kubernetes usability gap. The SPIFFE community would greatly benefit from Edâ€™s extensive open source governance and deep tech experience.
