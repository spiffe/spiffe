# Andrew Moore
Since 2019 I have contributed to SPIRE and drove internal usage of it at Uber across several platforms and workload types at scale, from low-level infrastructure, databases, and CI jobs to compute processes securing core business operations and customer data. I have made many internal contributions to a wrapping library for integration between company processes and SPIRE, and usage of related primitives. Additionally, I am one of the top listed contributors to spiffe/spire.

I frequently collaborate with current and upcoming internal users to plan integration and migration work to SPIFFE. I also own my team's SPIRE production readiness and observability, as well as consumer onboarding.
