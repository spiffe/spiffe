JJ is an industry veteran and is widely recognized as an expert in cloud native security (as evidenced by his previous roles and engagement in the CNCF Security TAG). His understanding of distributed systems, and the AuthN/AuthZ space in particular, never ceases to amaze me. JJ's work involves bringing these technologies together in order to provide cohesive service mesh solutions, which positions him well to see the full picture. This is a critical perspective for SSC success. I believe JJ would be a tremendously powerful force for good, acting upon both SPIFFE and the industry at large, should he accept this nomination and be elected.
