# Andres Vega
I am honored to nominate Andres Vega for the SPIFFE Steering Committee. Andres
is a SPIFFE/SPIRE champion who has helped the project and community extensively
grow. In addition to being a long time friend to the SPIFFE project and author
of the SPIFFE Turtle Book, Andres has spent countless hours helping many
organizations adopt, plan, and deploy SPIFFE environments. Most importantly,
Andres has always taken a community first approach which is vital for the
continued success of SPIFFE.

## Words from Andres
Andres answered the following questions in support of his nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I have a been a contributor to the spiffe community for a number of yearsd. Some of my contributions to the project and its community include:

* Led the certification of the project to attain a Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices badge.
* Authored and led the CNCF SIG-Security assessment.
* Drove and represented the project moving from CNCF sandbox level into the incubation stage.
* Delivered a number of SPIFFE/SPIRE webinars and trainings.
* Coauthored "Solving the Bottom Turtle"

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
What excites me the most of SSC participation is voicing the needs of the end users in order to ease adoption and consumption of spiffe in production systems. My other side hustle is security advisory to the CNCF ecosystem. As such I'm hopeful to help crosspolinate spiffe integrations with other technologies in the ecosystem.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
Two other growth areas I'm passionate about about is democratizing the use of spire by setting it into a direction that is set and forget it. So easy that someone that does not possess domain expertise can consume it. And then, integrations, integrations, integrations. What I mean by that is I'd like to see a future of a more secure cloud native ecosystem where the top 50 OSS projects support SPIFFE authentication natively.
