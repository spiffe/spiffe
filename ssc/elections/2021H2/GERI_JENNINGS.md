# Geri Jennings
Geri is an engineering manager who has been involved in SPIFFE and SPIRE since her time at CyberArk, in particular working on the adjacent products Conjur and Secretless. I believe she'd make an excellent SSC member due to (a) her domain experience in authentication and secrets management, (b) her experience in catalysing and maintaining open-source communities, and (c) her continued passion and investment in the SPIFFE project.

## Words From Geri
Geri answered the following questions in support of her nomination.

**What makes you a good fit for the SPIFFE Steering Committee?**  
I first became aware of SPIFFE / SPIRE when I joined the CNCF Security SIG in April 2018. At the time, I was working as a software engineer building a transparent authentication proxy that CyberArk eventually released as Secretless Broker. I joined the CNCF Security SIG so that I could be a part of the conversations happening around cloud-native security, and I found in SPIFFE a project that used familiar terminology (like zero trust and least privilege) to describe the ideal, safe, developer-friendly path forward.

In my work over the past several years as a cloud-native vendor, the central role that SPIFFE / SPIRE play in the cloud-native security landscape has become clear. In the end, privileged access management in dynamic, modern environments isn't possible without a mechanism to identify the workloads running in these environments - or put another way, modern access control requires a modern mechanism for defining what a workload's identity is.

**What aspects of SSC participation are you most excited about?**  
I've always appreciated and respected the work of the SPIFFE team, and have looked for opportunities to personally contribute. With the creation of the SSC I am happy to have found something that will use my skills! The work ahead of the group is very much in line with my recent experience as an engineering manager responsible for building the open source program at CyberArk. I am eager to engage with the SPIFFE community and to collaborate with the SSC members on defining the mission and values, tracking the progress and goals, and building the governance model.

**Is there anything else you'd like to say as part of your nomination?**  
I'm really grateful to be nominated, and I am excited for the chance to serve on the SPIFFE Steering Committee!
