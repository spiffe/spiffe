# Donations

As an open source CNCF graduated project, when it comes to events the SPIFFE organization relies upon:
- Support, tools, and entitlements from the CNCF
- The generosity of maintainers to give their precious time
- The generosity of maintainers to absorb the financial cost of coordination of and travel to events

To the last point, there are two mitigations:
- A community member's employer or other affiliation reimbursing costs
- Crowdfunded donations

In the [financial](../README.md) folder there are other subfolders for purpose-specific reimbursements.

Where possible, we will maintain crowdfunding links so you can show appreciation to our dedicated maintainers.

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions related to donations, reach out to the [SSC](ssc@spiffe.io).
