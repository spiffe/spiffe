# Travel Policy and Reimbursement

At time of writing, there is not a fully detailed, formal, objective travel reimbursement policy- Reimbursement will be based on best reasonable judgement of the [SSC](ssc@spiffe.io) and as funds allows.

## Call to action

At time of writing, the Linux Foundation's crowdfunding site does not allow group or multi-member ownership and accountability for a fund.
It is the opinion of the SSC that in the best case this reduces availability and velocity of reimbursement due to the "bus factor," and in the worst case reduces accountability and auditability.

You can help boost attention to this problem by filing a feature request at [LFX support](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4). Navigate to "Other LFX" > "Get Help with Crowdfunding."

Title: `[Feature request] Allow multiple owners of a crowdfund`
Description: `Crowdfunds should be able to have multiple admins to increase accountability and ensure fund access if the original owner is unavailable.`

## Getting reimbursed

### Qualifications

Please reach out to the SSC *ASAP* about travel plans you would like to be reimbursed for. The SSC can never guarantee fund availability, but there is increased likelihood and %-coverage of reimbursement the earlier you reach out.

At this time, the SSC prefers reimbursements to those acting as maintainers/leads within the SPIFFE community for the purpose of *executing events on behalf of a SPIFFE project*. Those who travel to only *attend events*, or whose core purpose in executing an event is not on behalf of a SPIFFE project, are unlikely to receive reimbursement.

At this time, and in conjunction with the above guideline, the SSC also prefers reimbursements to those most financially burdened in their travel. To give extreme ends of an example, a maintainer running a SPIFFE booth in their home city will be unlikely to even be reimbursed for parking costs, while a maintainer running the same SPIFFE booth who had to travel across the globe will be prioritized for reimbursement.

### Process

As early as possible, communicate to the SSC that you would like to be reimbursed for a current or upcoming expense.
After discussion, you will be added as a `Beneficiary` to the crowdfund (if not already), which will generate emails with instructions on `Expensify` and how to join LFX Crowdfunding and submit requests.
*At this stage, you are only set up to submit requests. You should not consider your reimbursement request approved fully or in part.*

Once you have all your legible receipts in order, follow Expensify's process for submitting [`Reimbursement`](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/crowdfunding/get-reimbursed). Pitfall: do not submit an `Invoice`. `Reimbursement` is what you want to do.

After submission, the SSC will reach out as needed. The SSC will be as fair and reasonable as possible when deliberating about all current and anticipated requests, and decisions regarding use of funds are final.

## SSC Instructions

On initial contact from a requestor who is verified as legitimate and reasonable (not necessarily that their specific expense should be approved), they can be added to the list of `Beneficiaries` in the crowdfund. This will send them emails to join `Expensify` for the crowdfund and provide steps for usage.

The owner of the crowdfund will receive email notifications for reimbursement applications via LFX and Expensify.
The owner will bring relevant documentation to the SSC private slack channel, or other private communications within the SSC, to determine reimbursement approval and amounts.

Given the SSC may have received multiple communications ahead of time for potential reimbursements, the SSC should wait a reasonable period until all requests are received so that funds can be disbursed in the most fair and reasonable manner possible.

The owner of the crowdfund will not accept requests without first consulting the rest of SSC.
