## SPIFFE Slack Channel Communication Guidelines

### Overview

To foster a productive and positive community, we have established the 
following guidelines for professional and respectful communication within the 
SPIFFE Slack channel. These guidelines apply to all members, including consumers, 
maintainers, and contributors.

### General Conduct

#### Be Respectful

* Treat all members with respect and courtesy.
* Avoid personal attacks, harassment, and discriminatory language.

#### Be Professional

* Maintain a professional tone in all communications.
* Focus on technical issues and constructive discussions.

#### Be Inclusive

* Welcome and encourage participation from all community members.
* Respect diverse perspectives and experiences.

### Communication Etiquette

#### Stay on Topic

* Keep discussions relevant to the SPIFFE project and related technical issues.
* Use appropriate channels for off-topic conversations.

#### Use Appropriate Language

* Avoid using slang, jargon, or abbreviations that may not be understood by 
  all members.
* Use clear and precise language to communicate your message.

### Conflict Resolution

#### Address Issues Privately

If a conflict arises, try to resolve it privately with the involved parties.
Use direct messages for personal disagreements or sensitive issues.

#### Seek Mediation

If a private resolution is not possible, seek mediation from a designated 
moderator or impartial SSC member.
Provide context and details to facilitate a fair resolution.

#### Follow the Escalation Process

If disruptive behavior continues, follow the escalation process outlined in the
[Procedure for Engaging With Vendor Companies](vendor-companies-engagement-procedure.md)
documentation.

Respect the decisions made regarding conflict resolution.

### Reporting Issues

#### Report Disruptive Behavior

* If you observe disruptive behavior, report it to a moderator or an SSC member.
* Provide specific details and context to help address the issue.

#### Maintain Confidentiality

* Respect the privacy and confidentiality of all members when reporting issues.
* Avoid publicly discussing reported incidents to prevent escalation.

### Consequences for Violations

#### Initial Warning

Members who violate these guidelines will receive an initial warning outlining 
the behavior and consequences of continued violations.

#### Temporary Suspension

* Repeated violations may result in a temporary suspension from the Slack channel.
* The duration of the suspension will be determined by SSC.

#### Permanent Removal

* Severe or repeated violations may result in permanent removal from the Slack 
  channel.
* Decisions for permanent removal will be made by the SSC team and communicated
  to the interested parties.

### Feedback and Improvement

#### Provide Feedback:

* We encourage all members to provide feedback on these guidelines and the 
  overall community experience.
* Use designated channels or direct messages to share your thoughts and 
  suggestions.

### Continuous Improvement

We will regularly review and update these guidelines based on community feedback 
and observed behavior.

Our goal is to create a positive and productive environment for all SPIFFE 
community members.
