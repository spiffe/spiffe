## About SPIFFE

Hello World ... The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) Project defines a framework and set of
standards for identifying and securing communications between web-based services. At its heart, SPIFFE is:

* A standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are called *SPIFFE IDs* and are implemented as [Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier).

* A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or *SVIDs*.

* An API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the *Workload API*.

The SPIFFE Project is also producing a reference implementation that, in addition to the above, will:

* Perform node and workload attestation.
* Implement a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.
* Provide an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated SPIFFE IDs.

## SPIFFE Standards

* [Secure Production Infrastructure Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE)](standards/SPIFFE.md)
* [The SPIFFE Identity and Verifiable Identity Document](standards/SPIFFE-ID.md)
* [The X.509 SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document](standards/X509-SVID.md)
* The Workload API ([WIP](https://github.com/spiffe/spire/blob/master/proto/api/workload/workload.proto))

## Getting Started

* [spiffe](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe): This repository includes the SPIFFE ID, SVID and Workload API specifications, example code, and tests, as well as project governance, policies, and processes.    
* [spire](https://github.com/spiffe/spire): This is a reference implementation of SPIFFE and the SPIFFE Workload API that can be run on and accross varying hosting environments.
* [spiffe-examples](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-example): Examples and demonstrations.
* [go-spiffe](https://github.com/spiffe/go-spiffe): Golang client libraries.

### SIGs & Working Groups<a name="sigs"></a>

Most community activity is organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs), time-bounded working groups, and our monthly community-wide meetings. SIGs follow these [guidelines](GOVERNANCE.md#sigs), although each may operate differently depending on their needs and workflows. Each group's material can be found in the [/sigs](/sigs) directory of this repository.
